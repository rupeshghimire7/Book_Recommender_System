# Book Recommender System
Welcome to the **Book Recommender System** project! This system is designed to provide book recommendations based on popularity and collaborative filtering. Whether you're a book enthusiast looking for the most popular books or seeking personalized recommendations, this system has you covered.


## Introduction

The Book Recommender System is divided into two main components:

**Popularity-Based Filtering**: The landing page displays the 100 most popular books based on some predefined criteria. This provides users with a quick overview of trending books.

**Collaborative Filtering Recommender**: Users can search for a specific book using regular expressions (regex). The system will then find the best match and recommend 5 similar books based on cosine similarity between books.

## Features
